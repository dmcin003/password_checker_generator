# password_checker_generator

This python program is a strong password checker/generator. The program will first give you the requirements of a strong password and then ask the user to enter his/her password into the command line. If the user submits a strong password the password is successfully created and the program exits. If the user submits a weak password, the program will ask the user if they would like to receive a strong password. If yes then it is generated by the program and then exits. If No, the user is prompted to enter their password of choice again.
